Coverage Priorities:<\/h4><p>Founded in 2015, HKFP&#8217;s mission is to be the most credible, impartial and independent news outlet on Hong Kong affairs, and to help safeguard press freedom in the city. We seek to amplify the voices of the voiceless whilst bridging the gap between the Chinese and English languages.<\/p><p>We prioritise Hong Kong matters in our coverage, followed by China, Taiwan and Macau. In our coverage, we give special attention to under-represented, underprivileged or marginalised communities, such as reporting on issues facing low-income, ethnic or sexual minorities. HKFP has eight full-time staff &#8211; half of our audience is Hong Kong-based, whilst the rest reside overseas.<\/p><h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"guiding-principles\"><strong>10 Guiding Principles<\/strong>:<\/h4><ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>HKFP will ensure the safety of staff and freelancers as a guiding, overriding concern in all of our work.<\/li>\n\n<li>HKFP will provide accurate, balanced and impartial news coverage, and correct errors quickly and transparently, upholding our Ethics Code.<\/li>\n\n<li>HKFP will not misrepresent information or quotes and will report truthfully. We will be transparent about our sources of information. We will never submit a story to a source for vetting.<\/li>\n\n<li>HKFP is answerable to only readers \u2013 our independence means we are able to resist censorship and self-censorship. As such, our language must be free of bias, influence and prejudice.<\/li>\n\n<li>HKFP should honour the trust of our sources and protect their confidentiality. We will seek their informed consent and never knowingly jeopardise their safety.<\/li>\n\n<li>HKFP should respect the presumption of innocence.<\/li>\n\n<li>HKFP should take care when dealing with victims or relatives who are grieving to avoid further trauma. We will seek parental consent when interviewing and taking photos of children.<\/li>\n\n<li>HKFP staff and freelancers do not use subterfuge or manipulation, nor violate privacy, to gather news. An editor may, however, approve an undercover investigation in light of safety reasons or the public interest. We will identify ourselves as HKFP journalists unless in exceptional, pre-approved circumstances or if there is a risk to safety.<\/li>\n\n<li>HKFP does not pay sources or use information gathered for personal benefit or financial gain.<\/li>\n\n<li>HKFP should be as transparent about our funding as possible. We will retain reserves to ensure the longevity of HKFP as a permanent fixture in the media landscape in the face of legal or existential uncertainty. <\/li><\/ol><hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"\/><h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-practices\">Best Practices:<\/h4><p id=\"actionable-feedback\"><strong>Actionable Feedback<\/strong><\/p><ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Our readers are frontline witnesses to life in Hong Kong \u2013 public safety, politics, housing, social issues, schools, and culture \u2013 and your insights can help shape our news agenda. We invite your news tips,&nbsp;ideas, story or&nbsp;source suggestions,&nbsp;corrections, enquiries or complaints. We believe that news organisations have a responsibility to engage with the public on the values, issues, and ideas of the day and that we have much to gain in return. <a href=\"https:\/\/hongkongfp.com\/contact-us\/\">View our contact channels here.<\/a><\/li><\/ul><p id=\"bylines\"><strong>Bylines<\/strong> <strong>and<\/strong> <strong>Datelines<\/strong><\/p><ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>In the interests of transparency and accountability, all of our news reports carry the reporter\u2019s name, biography and a headshot &#8211; or a joint byline if two journalists were equally involved. If there are uncertainties relating to safety or security, we may obfuscate the reporter&#8217;s name with the use of an HKFP staff byline. If a report was a team effort, we will state their names at the top of the article. If a colleague had a minor role in a report, we will add their name at the bottom as \u201cadditional reporting.\u201d (See also: Anonymity.)<\/li>\n\n<li>All of our on-the-ground reporting is generated in Hong Kong. As Hong Kong is a city-state, and since HKFP has no staff or bureaus elsewhere in the world, we do not include datelines. <\/li><\/ul><p id=\"diversity-statement\"><strong>Diversity Statement &amp; Staffing:<\/strong><\/p><ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>HKFP values inclusion and diversity &#8211; both in the newsroom and in our output \u2013 as part of our adherence to fair, balanced and accurate coverage.<\/li>\n\n<li>These values are inkeeping with our commitment to amplify voices from under-represented, underprivileged or marginalised groups, and our staff and freelancers are encouraged to seek out stories faced by these communities. In 2022, HKFP\u2019s efforts were recognised with a <a href=\"https:\/\/hongkongfp.com\/2022\/11\/16\/editorial-hkfp-wins-hk105k-backing-from-googles-news-equity-fund\/\">Google News Equity<\/a> grant.<\/li>\n\n<li>For instance, when we collect on-the-ground opinions from the public, our reporters seek to balance voices from different age groups, genders and ethnic backgrounds. Reporters also have access to a database listing female and non-binary sources to help ensure more gender diversity in our daily reporting and features.<\/li>\n\n<li>HKFP has no tolerance for any forms of discrimination, prejudice or bullying &#8211; all freelancers, contractors, job applicants, full and part-time staff are treated with respect, fairness and dignity. We do not make recruitment or promotion decisions, nor do we discriminate, along the lines of age, gender or sexual orientation, religion, race, pregnancy or marital status. As a newsroom, hiring decisions are based on ability, language skills, past experience and performance, the role&#8217;s stated requirements, and our recruitment tests and interview.<\/li>\n\n<li>Our journalists require English and Cantonese fluency, whilst all staff require permanent residency (i.e. we are unable to obtain visas for foreign applicants) . Coupled with the fact that Hong Kong is a 91.6 per cent ethically Chinese city-state, our staff generally have a Chinese ethnic background.<\/li>\n\n<li>HKFP publicly encourages job applications from candidates from minority backgrounds.<\/li>\n\n<li>Currently, 55.5 per cent of our staff are female, whilst 44.5 per cent are male. 77.7 per cent of our staff speak Cantonese, English and Putonghua, whilst 22.2 per cent speak an additional language. The current age range of staff is 24-41. At least a quarter of our staff come from a modest socioeconomic background.<\/li>\n\n<li>Since our founding in 2015, HKFP has employed nationals of Hong Kong, mainland China, the UK, India, Taiwan, Canada and Malaysia.<\/li><\/ul><p id=\"masthead-staff\"><strong>Masthead:<\/strong><\/p><ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Our executive team includes <a href=\"https:\/\/hongkongfp.com\/author\/tomgrundy\/\">Tom Grundy<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/hongkongfp.com\/author\/mercedeshkfp\/\">Mercedes Hutton<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/hongkongfp.com\/author\/hillaryleung\/\">Hillary Leung<\/a>, who have editorial responsibility in our production line, which is manned by frontline and senior journalists.

The use of anonymous sources should be an exception, not the rule.  <\/li>\n\n<li>HKFP will explain why we could not identify a source, and &#8211; if a pseudonym is granted &#8211; we will declare it in the first instance. <\/li>\n\n<li>HKFP will share as much as possible about why we protected a source, avoiding attributing information to simply &#8220;a source.&#8221; Instead, for instance, we may refer to &#8220;a senior figure at the university familiar with the drafting of the policy,&#8221; or &#8220;a civil servant who was present at the departmental meeting.&#8221;<\/li>\n\n<li>Reasons we may grant confidentiality include concerns over safety, job security, or due to legal reasons relating to ongoing court cases.<\/li>\n\n<li>HKFP journalists will, otherwise, encourage sources to be fully identified. However, we may speak to some sources &#8211; especially if there are risks involved &#8211; using three levels of attribution:<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>On the record: All statements are directly quotable and attributable, by name and title, to the person making the statement. <em>For example: &#8220;The city will shut down on Thursday owing to the typhoon,&#8221; said Hong Kong Observatory meteorologist Alex Lam.<\/em><\/li>\n\n<li>Off the record: Quotes may be used without naming them in full. We may only refer to \u201can official with knowledge of the incident,\u201d or can we state \u201ca high-ranking Foreign Ministry official who attended the meeting.\u201d<\/li>\n\n<li>On background: Information is for a reporter&#8217;s use only and cannot be published. The information may not be taken to another source in hopes of obtaining confirmation, unless such a practice has been negotiated with the source.<\/li><\/ul><\/li>\n\n<li>The identity of sources granted confidentiality are always known to the HKFP reporter and disclosed to editors. Our team may request extra verification to corroborate their identity and the information provided. For example, we would ask that a whistle-blower at a company accused of corruption shares evidence, along with their company ID and business card via an encrypted channel.<\/li>\n\n<li>HKFP journalists must request, and explain, the use of anonymous sources in advance with an editor.

Other multimedia, such as graphics, should be scaled correctly, and sources should be presented transparently.<\/li>\n\n<li>HKFP must not passively restate material given to us; instead, we will challenge our sources and fact-check their statements.

Few A.I. tools include proper sourcing or attribution information, therefore HKFP will not currently be adopting generative A.I. for any news writing, image generation or fact-checking. Nor will we quote such bots as a source. HKFP&#8217;s audience must be assured that our output is the work of our journalists and freelancers, and not created by third-party technology.<\/li>\n\n<li>We may nevertheless use internally-approved A.I. tools for grammar\/spell checking, for rewording\/summarising existing text written by our team, and for assisting with translations, transcriptions, or for research. Specifically, we may make use of trusted A.I. tools that have been exclusively trained on HKFP&#8217;s archive, or may consult them for story\/interview question ideas, or for assistance with coding, mathematical tasks or data crunching.

If this is impractical &#8211; such as with reports of breaking news, disasters or conflicts &#8211; reporters will judge the value of the story and inform their seniors before publishing without parental consent. Any major intrusion into children\u2019s lives must have a sound public interest justification.<\/li>\n\n<li>HKFP journalists and editors will consider whether the story will harm or embarrass children in the future and, when appropriate, take measures to obscure their identities for their protection.<\/li><\/ul><p id=\"Data\"><strong>Data<\/strong><\/p><ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Data mined must be thoroughly checked for accuracy and originate from a reliable source.

If several trustworthy media outlets reports the death of a public figure using an identified source, we may pick up the story with approval from editors and cite the outlets.

HKFP will avoid excessive detail about the method used in suicide, and will avoid publishing before official confirmation of the suicide, oversimplifying, or speculating about the reason behind it. HKFP will avoid sensationalising details in the headline or story, over-emphasising the problem of suicide as an \u201cepidemic,\u201d or prominently placing stories related to a suicide on our platforms. At the bottom of any story involving suicide, we will include a link to resources which support people at risk. We will not say a person \u201ccommitted suicide,\u201d which is a dated reference to when suicide was criminalised. We may instead state that a person \u201ctook their own life,\u201d \u201ckilled themselves,\u201d or \u201cdied by suicide.\u201d<\/li>\n\n<li>False or careless reporting on death can cause unnecessary distress.

Editors will consider whether it adds to the understanding of a story, and will resist including something simply to appeal to morbid interest. HKFP will usually pixelate or exclude instances of dismembered limbs, mutilated bodies, executions, or the moment of death. We will consider whether imagery may cause distress to viewers or the victim\u2019s family or damage the dignity of those involved.<\/li>\n\n<li>HKFP will add a prominent warning for viewers if we choose to publish graphic content of a violent, disturbing or sexual nature. We may also place such content in a &#8220;click to view&#8221; enclosure. <\/li>\n\n<li>Live broadcasts in which situations arise that are in violation of our graphic imagery guidelines will be immediately terminated.<\/li><\/ul><p id=\"hate-speech-and-incitement-to-violence\"><strong>Hate Speech and Incitement to Violence<\/strong><\/p><ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>HKFP will be careful when repeating offensive language such as hate speech, racial slurs, derogatory comments and incitements to violence unless there is genuine editorial reason to do so &#8211; for example, when it originates from a public figure. We will put the comments into context and solicit reactions. We may warn our audience about the content of the speech. <\/li>\n\n<li>HKFP does not censor profane language when, on rare occasions, it is used in the context of news reporting. However, we will obfuscate them from headlines, or on social media, where they may be accidentally encountered. <\/li>\n\n<li>Live broadcasts in which situations arise that are in violation of our hate speech and incitement guidelines will be immediately terminated.<\/li><\/ul><p id=\"HKFP-email-and-devices\"><strong>HKFP Email and Devices<\/strong><\/p><ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>HKFP employees only use their HKFP email account for work-related correspondence unless doing so would compromise the safety or confidentiality of a source.

If in the public interest, under the principles of legally guaranteed press freedom, HKFP may report on documents of a questionable legal origin such as leaked classified material with the approval of editors, but we will take care so as to not open ourselves up to potential legal action. (See also: <a href=\"https:\/\/hongkongfp.com\/qa-hkfp-and-the-national-security-law\/\">Security Law<\/a>).<\/li>\n\n<li>HKFP will respect the presumption of innocence &#8211; this means we avoid suggestions that an arrested or charged person is guilty.

If we are unable to do so, we will highlight that the rumour is unverified.
